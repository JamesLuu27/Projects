This is to test my project.
Top20 States is my Homework Assignment for Tableau. It's to showcase my ability to filter and order top 20 based on claim number or cost. The map graph shows that I can add tooltips along with showing specific states.
jamesluu2018youtube is based off a project on how I transfer excel data to tableau, and showcase the top trending videos of youtube in 2018. It's organized to show channel that exclude music. It is to see if youtube as a career would be viable or not.
